What we need to know:
file size [16 bits]
the characters, separated by line breaks

What this means:
to read in file, we need a parser
parser has to read in enough segments to encompass whole file
then has to loop through the file, printing to terminal and converting newline to enter

keystrokes now have to be saved to a memory heap
Very bad practice but we'll just choose a random offset and because this is the bootloader
we can assume this is safe to do

File will have to live at the end of the binary? will have to figure this out
To safely write we will need to know binary size
